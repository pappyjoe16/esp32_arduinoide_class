To connect to wifi from esp32 using wifi.h
	include <wifi.h>
	create a const to add ssid and network password
		const char* ssid = "****"
		const char* password = "*****"
	Set the wifi mode you would like the esp32 to work on, such as station. access point and station access point
		WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP_STA);  //Optional
	Begin the connection with 
		 WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
	Check for a successful connection to the network
		while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    			Serial.print("..");
    			delay(100);
  		}

	To get the local IP address 
		WiFi.localIP()

To use an ultrasonic sensor to get distance
	Declare two GPIO pins, trigger pin, and echo pin
	Trigger pin as output and echo pin for input
		pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);  // Sets the trigPin as an Output
  		pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);   // Sets the echoPin as an Input
	To measure the distance 
		distance in cm = duration * sound_speed /2
		duration is the time it takes the ultrasonic sound to travel from the transmitter to the object and back 
		to the receiver 
		The sound speed is 0.034
